### Installing
It is recommended to run this code in a virtual environment. I used `venv` for this project. 
To setup the virtual environment and download all the necessary packages, follow the steps below

First, load the Python module you want to use:
```
module load python/3.8
```

Then, create a virtual environment in your home directory:

```
python -m venv $HOME/<env>
```
Where `<env>` is the name of your environment. Finally, activate the environment:

```
source $HOME/<env>/bin/activate
```

Now to install the packages simply run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
